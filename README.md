# 🚀🚀 Semester_1_Cplusplus_basics


This repository contains a collection of C++ programs written during the first semester of my Software Engineering degree. These programs helped me build a strong understanding of programming logic and syntax using the C++ language. All code is written clearly and is helpful for beginners looking to learn or practice C++.

#🧾 What’s Included:
<br>
<br>

🔤 Input & Output
Basic programs using cin and cout, with formatting output using endl.

🔁 Loops
Examples using for, while, and do-while loops. Includes pattern printing, reverse counting, and logic-based loop tasks.

🧠 Conditional Statements
if, if-else, else-if, and switch-case programs for decision making. Use of break, continue, and nested conditions.

🧮 Arrays (1D & 2D)
Programs that use arrays to store and process data. Includes input/output, finding max/min, sum, search, and basic sorting. Also includes basic 2D array input and traversal.

📐 Mathematical Programs
Factorial, even/odd check, prime numbers, Fibonacci series, palindrome, Armstrong number, LCM, GCD, and sum/product of digits.

🧩 Functions
Modular programs using user-defined functions. With and without parameters or return values. Focus on reuse and clarity.

🔣 Characters & ASCII
Working with char data type, vowel/consonant checks, case conversion, and basic ASCII-based logic.

➕ Operators & Expressions
Usage of arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators. Includes type conversion and compound expressions.
